Hello Anne, 

I understand your situation. However, the deadline for our Summer Interview Prep course was already over and we can't accommodate late applications anymore. 

We can share with you our [high-level software interview guide](https://hackmd.io/@nesquena/HJN9k17sm?type=view) that may be helpful for you. 
You may visit our page for additional references and sign up to our mailing list to receive updates for our future courses. 

All the best, <br>
