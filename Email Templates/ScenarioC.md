Hello Dennis, 

Thank you for reaching out. We are still waiting for at least one more applicant from your school to complete their requirements in order for you to be admitted to the course. 
Rest assured that your application is already processed and we will admit you after the additional applicant. 

For the mean time, you can refer your friends from your school to apply for the role and you may be working together in running the course. 
We will update you of any progress. 

Thank you for your patience, <br>
Ian Raye <br>
